🔎 Employee Identity Exposure Risk Assessment (OSINT)
📌 Overview

This project presents an OSINT-based assessment of publicly discoverable employee identities associated with a corporate domain.

The purpose of this research was not to identify individuals, but to evaluate whether publicly accessible employee identity data could increase organizational risk through:

Phishing

Social engineering

Credential-based attacks

🎯 Objective

To determine:

Whether employee identities linked to an organization are publicly discoverable and if this exposure could enable targeted cyber threats.

This assessment focuses on identity exposure risk, not system compromise.

🧠 Key Insight

Even in the absence of confirmed data breaches, publicly accessible employee identities combined with predictable corporate email structures can significantly increase susceptibility to:

Spear phishing

Impersonation attacks

Credential stuffing

Business email compromise (BEC)

🛠 Methodology

This research was conducted using publicly available information only.

Techniques used:

LinkedIn employee discovery

Email format inference

Maltego identity mapping

Public breach database verification

🔍 Assessment Approach

The workflow followed:

Identify publicly listed employees

Infer corporate email structure

Map identity footprint using Maltego

Check exposure in breach datasets

Evaluate potential attack scenarios

📊 Findings

Employee identities are publicly discoverable

Corporate email formats can be inferred

No confirmed large-scale employee email breach was identified

However, identity exposure creates a measurable phishing risk

⚠️ Security Implication

Publicly accessible identity data enables attackers to:

Build targeted phishing campaigns

Infer corporate email structures

Conduct reconnaissance for social engineering

This represents an Identity Exposure Risk.

🖼️ Evidence

Redacted screenshots included demonstrate:

Public employee discoverability

Identity mapping via Maltego

Exposure verification attempts

All sensitive details have been anonymized.

🛡️ Ethical Considerations

No systems were accessed

No accounts were tested

No personal data is exposed

All information used was publicly available.

All screenshots and datasets are anonymized.

📈 Conclusion

No confirmed breach of employee data was identified.

However, publicly discoverable employee identities create an exploitable attack surface that could enable targeted phishing and impersonation threats.

Organizations should consider strengthening:

Identity awareness training

MFA enforcement

Breach monitoring
